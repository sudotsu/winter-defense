## Technical Methodology

### Assessment Algorithm

The tool uses multi-factor risk analysis:

```
Risk Score = (Species Vulnerability × Disease Presence)
           + (Structural Defects × Proximity to Target)
           + (Environmental Stress Factors)
           - (Maintenance History × Tree Age Appropriateness)
```

### Data Sources

- **Species Data:** ISA (International Society of Arboriculture) guidelines
- **Pest/Disease Info:** USDA Forest Service, Nebraska Forest Service
- **Cost Estimates:** Regional market data, industry standards
- **Risk Metrics:** Tree Risk Assessment Qualification (TRAQ) methodology

### Omaha-Specific Calibration

- **EAB Prevalence:** Adjusted for confirmed Omaha infestations
- **Soil Conditions:** Alkaline soil considerations (iron chlorosis)
- **Weather Patterns:** Ice storm, wind damage historical data
- **Growing Season:** USDA Zone 5b specifications

---

## Omaha-Specific Considerations

### Climate Factors

- **USDA Hardiness Zone:** 5b (-15°F to -10°F)
- **Annual Precipitation:** ~30 inches (variable)
- **Soil Type:** Predominantly alkaline clay
- **Wind Exposure:** Prairie winds increase storm risk

### Common Local Issues

1. **Ice Storm Damage** - Heavy ice accumulation weakens branches
2. **Alkaline Soil** - Causes iron chlorosis in sensitive species
3. **EAB Infestation** - Active throughout Omaha metro
4. **Late Spring Freezes** - Damage new growth

### Seasonal Timing Recommendations

- **Winter Pruning (Dec-Feb):** Optimal for most species, disease transmission minimized
- **EAB Treatment (Apr-Sep):** Active growing season required
- **Storm Preparation (Oct-Nov):** Before winter weather
- **Disease Treatment (Varies):** Species and condition dependent

---

## Maintenance Recommendations by Assessment

### After Low-Risk Assessment
- **Monitoring:** Annual visual inspection
- **Pruning Cycle:** Every 3-5 years
- **Next Assessment:** 2-3 years

### After High-Risk Assessment
- **Professional Inspection:** Within 30 days
- **Pruning:** Within current season
- **Monitoring:** Every 6 months
- **Treatment:** As recommended by arborist

### After Extreme-Risk Assessment
- **Immediate Action:** Contact professional within 48 hours
- **Safety Measures:** Restrict access beneath tree
- **Documentation:** Photos, measurements
- **Insurance Notification:** If applicable
