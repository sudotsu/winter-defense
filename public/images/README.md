## Image Optimization Tips

Before uploading images:
1. Resize to recommended dimensions
2. Compress using TinyPNG.com or Squoosh.app
3. Aim for < 200KB per image for fast loading
4. Use JPG for photos, PNG for logos

## Stock Photos (Temporary)

The site currently uses Unsplash images. These are fine for testing, but replace them ASAP with your real photos for maximum trust and conversion.

## Adding More Images

Put any additional images in this folder and reference them in your code as:
```jsx
<img src="/images/your-image.jpg" alt="Description" />
```

The `/images/` path works because Vite serves the `public` folder at the root.
