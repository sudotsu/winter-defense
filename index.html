If your ash tree is healthy and valuable (large, well-positioned), treatment costs $150-$400 every 2-3 years and is 95% effective. If the tree shows more than 30% canopy decline, removal is more cost-effective than treatment. Our diagnostic tool helps you decide." }

However, hazardous trees should be removed immediately regardless of season. Prices may be lower in winter due to reduced demand." }

Hire a professional for: trees over 15ft tall, trees near buildings or power lines, trees leaning toward structures, dead or diseased trees (unpredictable falls), or if you lack proper equipment and insurance. Most homeowner injuries occur during DIY tree work." }
